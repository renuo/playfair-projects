## Regression:
Regular linear regression and develop a prediction model

## Goals:
- Scatter plot with regression line, commenting on the extremes for most
interesting years.
- Use the predictor so users can input a nation from a list, and, based on
the past years, get a reply what  
- Do the same with specific jobs. I may, however, need to include the other
PERM data for this.
